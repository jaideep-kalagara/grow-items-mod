# Grow Items Mod

Grow Items is a Fabric mod that introduces a new “Item Grower” block which lets you **grow vanilla items over time**, similar to crops — but automated.

You can insert an input item + fuel → and the Item Grower slowly produces more of that same item.

### Upgrades
The Item Grower supports upgrade slots.  
Certain upgrade items (like the **Rich Soil Upgrade**) speed up the growth process.

More upgrades = faster growth.
